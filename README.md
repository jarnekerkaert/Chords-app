# Chords app
This app allows the user to put together chords based on a key so they can easily put together well sounding songs without much music knowledge.

### Install and run
To run this application, first clone this project and open it with android studio.

This application uses a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) backend connected to a [MongoDb database](https://www.mongodb.com/). The backend is currently not being hosted, so if you want to use this app, you will have to run the backend yourself. 

You can find it [here](https://github.com/jarnekerkaert/TictakBackend).
